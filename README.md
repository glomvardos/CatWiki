<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

I created this project with NextJS and SCSS modules, every request to the API is handled from the server-side.

All pages are pre-fetched and pre-rendered with getStaticProps and getStaticPaths with ISR configured at 1 day.

Most popular cats will be updated once a day based on searches from the users.

With love for our feline friends.
